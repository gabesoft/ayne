** Fixes
* Bookmarks page                                                       :home:
** Enhancements
- maybe make queries get their own URL
*** Improve the edit dialog experience
- maybe use the same button to show both info and edit
- the dialog should show closer to the button that opened it
- maybe make info open the pop up but only hover off 
the entire list item would close it
*** Implement a better way to count the URL clicks
- use a redirect page
- remove all logic related to click count from urlview
- currently this is done via the urlClick action
- this should work when clicking the original link in the pop up also
*** Make delete tag work better
- should not require two clicks
- should indicate that the tag has been deleted
*** Improve the URL input form
- better design
- bring back the focus functionality lost by removing the view
